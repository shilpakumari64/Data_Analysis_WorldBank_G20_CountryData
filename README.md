# Data_Analysis_WorldBank_G20_CountryData
## Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a data analysis project that focuses on analyzing and visualizing various economic indicators using Python, the Pandas library, and Tableau. The project utilizes data obtained from the World Bank's G20 Country Data API.

### Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to perform data cleaning, data preprocessing, and create insightful visualizations using Tableau. The following economic indicators have been analyzed and visualized:

1. Inflation Rate Over the Years: This visualization tracks the inflation rate of G20 countries over a specific time period. It helps to identify trends and patterns in the inflation rates of different countries.

2. Country-wise Unemployment: This visualization presents the unemployment rates across G20 countries. It allows for comparisons and highlights variations in unemployment levels between countries.

3. Access to Electricity: This visualization examines the percentage of the population with access to electricity in G20 countries. It provides insights into the disparities in electricity access across different regions.

4. Efficacy of Government Education Spending: This visualization explores the relationship between government education spending and educational outcomes in G20 countries. It helps to assess the effectiveness of government investments in education.

5. GDP vs Gross Capital Formation: This visualization compares the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross Capital Formation (GCF) of G20 countries. It illustrates the relationship between economic output and investment in physical assets.

6. Exports vs Imports: This visualization presents the trade balances of G20 countries by comparing exports and imports. It highlights countries with trade surpluses or deficits and identifies trading patterns.

7. Mobile Subscriptions vs GNI: This visualization analyzes the correlation between mobile subscriptions and Gross National Income (GNI) in G20 countries. It explores the relationship between mobile technology penetration and economic development.

8. FDI Distribution: This visualization showcases the distribution of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) across G20 countries. It identifies countries attracting the most FDI and provides insights into global investment trends.

### Project Workflow

1. Data Retrieval: The project utilizes the World Bank's G20 Country Data API to fetch the required economic indicators.

2. Data Cleaning: The obtained data is cleaned and preprocessed using Python and the Pandas library. This step involves handling missing values, formatting data types, and removing inconsistencies.

3. Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis techniques are applied to gain insights into the economic indicators. Statistical analysis and data visualization are used to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

4. Tableau Visualization: The cleaned and processed data is imported into Tableau for creating interactive visualizations. The visualizations are designed to effectively communicate key findings and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

### Repository Structure
